            About
          </h1>
          <br />
          <p class="">
            Hi there! I'm Dinesh. I am a passionate individual who enjoys
            building things with code.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My first experience with programming was when I was 14, but I didn't
            last long: I was a big fan of computer games like Minecraft, and I
            became curious about programming and started learning on my own.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Years later, I decided to try learning Python. It was a radically
            different experience. I distinctly remember the moment it clicked;
          </p>
          <p>
            I was reading <strong style="text-decoration: underline">"The Second World War"</strong>ðŸ“š book, and they
            were encrypting message using big enigma machines. And it made me
            wonder: how would it work with todays computing power?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It occurred to me: I had the skills to build a simulation! So I
            threw together a python script that would run thousands of
            simulations to work out what the right answer was. 15 minutes later,
            I had the answer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since then, I've been learning new skills and In my spare time I have developed web-app with <strong style="text-decoration: underline">Millions of users</strong>âœ¨.
            I recently graduated. I'm seeking a full-time role where I can help
            a company achieve their goals.
